              Arnold Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947, near Graz, Austria. Schwarzenegger's childhood was far from ideal. His father, Gustav, was an alcoholic police chief and one-time member of the Nazi Party, who clearly favored Arnold's brother over his gangly, seemingly less athletic younger son. When Schwarzenegger immigrated to the United States in 1968, he helped propel the bodybuilding into the mainstream, culminating in the 1977 documentary, Pumping Iron, which tells the tale of Schwarzenegger's defense of his Mr. Olympia crown.</p>

              Schwarzenegger was known as the Styrian Oak, or Austrian Oak, in the bodybuilding world, where he dwarfed his competition. He won his first amateur Mr. Universe title in 1967. After moving to California in 1968 to train and compete in bigger events in the United States, he won four more Mr. Universe titles and then the professional Mr. Olympia title six years in a row (1970–75) before retiring. He surprised the bodybuilding world by returning to competition one more time to claim the Mr. Universe title in 1980. Bodybuilding was the subject of several of his books, including the autobiographical Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder (1977; cowritten with Douglas Kent Hall) and The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding (1998; cowritten with Bill Dobbins).</p>

              Schwarzenegger became a U.S. citizen in 1983 and married reporter Maria Shriver in 1986. He is a registered Republican. He describes himself as fiscally conservative and socially moderate. During the 1990s he became increasingly active in the Republican Party at both the state and national levels, and in 2003 he was elected governor of California in a recall election. In his initial years in office, Schwarzenegger pushed for a number of restrictive measures that proved unpopular, especially with organized labour. Nevertheless, he was reelected in 2006. He earned key legislative victories on issues relating to the environment, including a landmark act to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in California, and successfully advocated for ballot propositions to reform the state’s redistricting process and political-primary format.</p>
